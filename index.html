            Title: Making Monitoring Matter Through Strong Statistical Collaborations
            </li>
            <li>
            Abstract:  For long-term monitoring program viability there is a premium on sound statistical underpinnings, particularly for taxa that contribute economic impacts either negatively (invasive weeds estimated $34 billion/yr) or positively (bats as agricultural pest eaters estimated $3.7 to $53 billion/yr and pollinators estimated $200 billion/yr). The critical statistical elements when conducting field-based surveys are the spatio-temporal design (which determines when and where to sample and how many locations for data collection) and the inference design (which outlines the statistical analysis to answer program objectives). I will overview my efforts since 2007 to assist natural resource monitoring programs in their goal to “make monitoring matter.” Applied statisticians begin by understanding our collaborator’s science and information needs. Then, we investigate whether the current study design and/or statistical analyses used to attack their problem fail to capture critical aspects that, if ignored, can lead to misleading conclusions. Those situations in which the conventional approaches fall short motivate us to discover innovative statistical solutions. I will highlight examples of cost-efficient and optimal sampling designs we have developed for bats, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, and a long-lived tree species. Additionally, I will share some collaborations that led to novel statistical methods that infuse biological realism and, consequently, provide deeper ecological insights from field-based data. We focus on, and are motivated by, the need for practical, solution-oriented guidance that can be adopted and implemented by agency and academic scientists.
